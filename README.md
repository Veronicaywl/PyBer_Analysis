## Summary

Here are some recommendation for Pyber city: Increase the number of drivers in rural city. Ensure the number of drivers meet the ride demand. The total fare shows high in rural cities indicated the rides per driver drives a longer distance. That could be the reason why the fare per rides is high. By increasing the drivers meet the ride demand of the cities can lower the cost of fare per rides.
